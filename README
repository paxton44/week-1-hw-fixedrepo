To whom this may concern, here are the steps I took to fix Horieson's website.

1.) Changed Website name to Horieson. 

2.)<h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1> *fixed by removing span and combining to div*

3.) I put div into section to organize and allow the hrefs to be centered to the right within the header. also changed CSS 
    positioning on "main-services" to inline to allow alignment with the <h1>-->

4.) This link is broken because it is not using an id# so I changed it to id instead of class so in CSS and I also changed anything SEO related to #search-engine-optimization to match styles-->

5.) I Changed height from 800px to 1000px to match image to example document (you can see by looking at the top left window in relation to the wood above the whiteboard)

6.) I fixed "benefits by changing height to 1000px in CSS" and changed the padding to 10px on the footer to match the example

7.) Deleted Horieson logo at bottom.
